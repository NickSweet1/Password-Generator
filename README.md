Description <br>
This program starts by declaring a function that will chose lower case, upper case, numbers, and symbols at random. <br> It then leads into the generatePassword function that will get the length of the password (as a string) and a while loop to ensure that the string meets all criteria. <br>The function then uses confirm to recieve boolean values from the user for each of the inputs. Followed by a while loop, this will ensure that the user has selected at least 1 (ONE) choice. <br> I then used if statements to and for loops to itterate though the random arrays that were made and add those to the userChoices array. <br>The final for loop will run for the length of the password. Every iteration of the for loop adds a random index of the userChoices array to the password variable. <br>
